# simple-blog
A simple blog system built with Node.js, Express.js, NeDB, Handlebars, AngularJS

The simple blog system I developed makes use of the following technologies:
- Node.js (Javascript platform for server-side applications)
- Express.js (web application framework for node.js)
- NeDB (lightweight MongoDB NO-SQL database)
- Handlebars (template engine)
- Everyauth (authentication)
- AngularJS (validation + in CreatePost page)
- Bootstrap (CSS framework)

To build and run the web application, the following procedure is required:
1. Install Node.js => https://nodejs.org/
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the project folder
3. Run "npm install"
4. Run "node server.js"
5. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:5000
